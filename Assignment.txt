Dear Professor Md. Khademul Islam Molla, PhD, 

I hope this email finds you well. I am interested in developing a vending machine using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. This project would involve designing and building a vending machine prototype capable of dispensing items or snacks based on user input, and integrating the Raspberry Pi Pico to control its functionality.

Here I have attached two reaseach paper from internet on microcontroller based vending machine system. they have used Arduino and AVR microcontroller, but I have to use only Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

Please let me know if you are available for a brief meeting or discussion at your convenience. I am eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions regarding this proposal.

Sincerely,
