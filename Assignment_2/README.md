### Inhertance: 
Dog and Cat are sub classes of the Animal super class, demonstrating Inheritance.

### Polymorphism: 
The 'makeSound()' method is overriden in both classes (Dog and Cat).

### Encapsulation
The attributes in Animal class (id, name, age) are encapsulated by private keyword. They accessed via getter() and setter() methods.

### Abstraction
The animal class is abstract class and cann't be instantiated directly. Animal class serves as a general blue print for all Animal related classes.
